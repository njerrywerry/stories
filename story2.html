	<h2>The Mantis and the San.</h2>
</head>
<body>
		<p>Although Mantis is a type of San 'super-being', the Namibian San / Bushmen do not regard him as a god, like the moon and sun.</p>

<p>Indeed, he is all too human and in many ways personifies the San himself.</p>

<p>He is a kind of dream Bushman, and resembles the real mantis, with his small wedge-shaped face and intelligent look.</p>

<p>The figures which primitive artists painted on the walls of their rock shelters, prance along like Mantis himself.</p>

<p>Mantis is very much a family man and likes to have his folk around him.</p>

<p>His wife is Dassie, the rock hyrax. His son is young Mantis, very like his resourceful father.</p>

<p>Then there is Porcupine who is an adopted daughter, whose real father is a weird monster called the All-Devourer, with whom she is too frightened to live.</p>

<p>Porcupine is married to a being who is neither human nor animal, but a part of the rainbow, called Kwammanga.</p>

<p>They have two sons, one called Kwammanga after his father, and the other Mongoose or, as he is sometimes known, Ichneumon. The latter is a bossy young character who is always putting his grandfather Mantis in his place.</p>

<p>Mantis also has a sister, a lovely lady called Blue Crane, of whom he is most fond.</p>

<p>So, this is the family of Mantis, and not all that strange a family, if compared to some human families.</p>
