		<p>The Efik myth of creation is as follows:</p>

<p>The creator, Abassi, created two humans and then decided to not allow them to live on earth. </p>

<p>His wife, Atai, persuaded him to let the people live on earth with him. </p>

<p>In order to control the humans, Abassi insisted that they eat all their meals with him, thereby keeping them from growing or hunting food. </p>

<p>He also forbade them to have children. But soon, though, the woman began growing food in the earth, and she stopped showing up to eat with Abassi. </p>

<p>Then the man joined his wife in the fields, and before long there were children also. </p>

<p>Abassi blamed his wife for the wrong way things had turned out, but she told him she would handle it. </p>

<p>She sent down to earth; death and discord to keep the people in their place, and their numbers down.  </p>
