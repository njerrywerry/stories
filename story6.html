		<p>The Ekoi are a tribe in southern Nigeria, Central Africa.</p>

<p>In the beginning there were two gods, Obassi Osaw and Obassi Nsi. </p>

<p>The two gods created everything together.</p>

<p>Then Obassi Osaw decided to live in the sky and Obassi Nsi decided to live on the earth. </p>

<p>The god in the sky gives light and moisture, but also brings drought and storms. </p>

<p>The god of the earth nurtures, and takes the people back to him in the sky, when they die. </p>

<p>One day long ago, Obassi Osaw made a man and a woman, and placed them upon the earth. </p>

<p>They knew nothing so Obassi Nsi taught them about planting and hunting to get food.</p>
